# ReactStarter

Starter kit for React projects with redux state management.
Configured be built with webpack and I have it setup to deploy to gh-pages.

Make sure you create a gh-pages branch and build the project before deploying.
I have added hot-reloading for development.

Steps for running:
1)npm install
2)npm start
3)Browse to localhost:3000 to view the project.

Steps for deploying to gh-pages:
1)switch to gh-pages branch
2)npm run build
3)commit the bundle file.
4)push to remote gh-pages branch: ie: git push origin gh-pages
5)view project at https://<username>.github.io/<Repository name>/
